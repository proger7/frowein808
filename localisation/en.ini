Cases of force majeure or other events occurring through no fault of our own entitle us to post-pone the delivery for the duration of the hindrance or to withdraw from the contract; in such case, we will inform the buyer immediately. Notice of default and contract cancellation due to exceeding the time of delivery are permissible only if agreed in writing. Claims for dam-ages due to non-delivery or delayed delivery or any other reason connected to the contact are excluded. Our shipments always travel at the risk of the buyer, even in case of postage paid deliveries. The buyer thus bears the transport risk including breakage, leakage, confiscation or other dispositions of higher authority. The transport insurance is covered by us – transport damages must be immediately reported to the respective transport company including application for a damage certifi-cate. Compensation is claimed by the consignee or by us on request. We ship at our best discretion without li-ability for the cheapest shipping method. Partial deliv-eries are permissible."
text6 = "Legitimate notices of complaints may be considered only if they are announced within 8 days after receipt of the shipment. Goods that are the object of a complaint must be in the same condition in which they were de-livered. In case of legitimate notice of defect, we are only obliged, at our discretion, either to offer a reason-able price reduction or to take the goods back in whole or insofar as defective. The purchase price for the quantity taken back is either subtracted from the total or we deliver non-defective replacement for the returned goods. Further claims, in particular claims for compen-sation, are excluded. Goods may be returned only with prior written agreement. In the event that goods are transferred to a third party, the goods are considered to have been unconditionally accepted. In addition, the corresponding warranty conditions apply for devices. Our written and verbal information and recommenda-tions represent the best of our knowledge; however, we assume no warranty. We are liable for uncompromised quality of the goods until delivery. Since use is outside of our range of influence and we cannot foresee all cir-cumstances of use, we accept no liability for possible direct or indirect damage that are the result of applica-tion for whatever reason and which may also occur when the goods are used in compliance with our in-structions. In addition, we do not accept liability for damages caused by transport, handling and storage. To the extent that the use of our goods is subject to le-gal provisions, the buyer is responsible for considering all related issues. Assurances on characteristics and possible uses of our goods apply only if made in writ-ing."
text7 = "Unless otherwise agreed, the payment is due no later than 30 days after date of invoice, independent of goods receipt and notwithstanding the right to compen-sation. Payments are to be made without any deduc-tion. In case of payments within 10 days from the date of invoice and for advance payment, a discount of 2% may be deducted. Failure to keep the agreed term of payment entitles us to charge, without prior notice of default, corresponding default interests equal to the currently valid basic interest rate (www.basiszinssatz.info). In case of check payments, the goods remain our property until the check is cashed. Retention or set-off of payments due to any claims or counterclaims of the buyer are excluded. In the event of doubt about the solvency of the buyer, we are entitled to withdraw from all pending delivery contracts or to demand advance payments for all exec-utory contracts. If we assert one of these rights, all in-voice amounts outstanding at that time are immediately due for payment."

The buyer has the right to collect the assigned claims, as long as we do not revoke this authorization. This au-thorization also lapses without express revocation upon suspension of payment of the buyer. At our request, the buyer shall immediately inform us in writing to whom he has sold goods or for whom he has carried out ser-vices and which claims arose from this for him. If the value of the securities existing for us exceeds our claims by more than 20%, we will release securities at our discretion at the request of the buyer. Pledge or chattel mortgaging to third parties before payment is inadmissible and legally invalid. In case of access by a third party, the buyer is obliged to object immediately and to inform us by registered letter. We can assert the reserved ownership at any time if the buyer is in default of payment or if there is a substantial deterioration in his asset position. In the event of insolvency proceed-ings over the assets of the buyer, we may request se-lection of the goods still on hand."
